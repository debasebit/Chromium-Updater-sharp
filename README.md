# Chromium-Updaterâ™¯
##### This project is no longer actively developed - Archival purposes only

This served to be a auto-updater for the open source Chromium web browser as it lacks the feature that is present within Google Chrome.

It was created back in 2012 and, although it compiles, it is broken (downloads the latest zip file but doesn't extract).

Only requires .NET 3.5 to be installed and have tested the build on Visual Studio 2015 (as of typing).

Screenshots coming soon...
